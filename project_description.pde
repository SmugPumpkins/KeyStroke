//PRESENTING: keySTROKE, a project by Nathan Forsyth

/*
I am not good at drawing. I do not think drawing is fun. But I wanted to make a fun program. 
Do you know what I do consider to be fun? Discovery. So I set out to
write a program that not only allows the user to discover, but encourages it. 
If you are reading this description before running the program, I advise you for the experience to be as intended
STOP READING NOW and go try it out! (scroll down to continue reading)

It was through play testing with my roommates that I settled on the mouse UI, the first prompter of discovery. 
Originally it was the pencil cursor by default, but nobody scrolled with it! And as I'm sure you discovered,
scrolling the mouse wheel is an integral part of the discovery experience! So the mouse icon is designed 
to make you think "Oh, what happens when I click? It draws! Right click? Nothing... Wait, it erased! Scroll?
Wow! It's red! Orange! Yellow!" The changing colours of buttons provides exactly the feedback a user needs
 to know they are on the right track. As people move to the keyboard, it's interesting to see how long it takes for them
to realize the UI itself resembles the keyboard. For some, its immediate, and they imediately press the control key to 
hide it. For others, it wasn't until 20 - 30 keystrkokes in. The most fascinating part for me is that everyone took
the journey one step at a time. I was expecting someone to just brush the whole keyboard but no! Every keystroke led
to them asking themselves "now what did that just do." Overall, it works as intended! I thought about putting keys
with similar functions in closer proximity on the keyboard, but I think the random layout nature of the inputs makes
each stroke feel like a discovery rather than discovering by sections.

My favourite feature though is how it names save files. It names them after the keystrokes you made! So everytime you look
at your save file, you have a record of the discoveries you made in the order you made them! It isn't perfect, with some keys 
needing to be renamed so they create valid file types, and if it exceeds 240 characters it resets with a counter for how many times
it had to reset iteslf. I hope you enjoyed! - Nathan
